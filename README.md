# react-presentation

This presentation will demonstrate the rendering pipeline needed to make react work on the server and the client. 
There will be points made on what you should be considering to go down this route and we will touch on some of 
the pros and cons. Then we will build up the pipeline piece by piece. We will start with a straight ES5 implementation, 
showing off the pieces in their native form, then add JSX/ES2015 transpiling and the toolsets around that. 
Through this process, there will be demonstrations of what is needed to make it possible to have the same code running 
on the server and client.
